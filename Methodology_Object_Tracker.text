Methodology:
Video Loading: Load the video file using OpenCV's VideoCapture function.
Tracker Initialization: Define a tracker using OpenCV's TrackerCSRT_create function.
Object Selection: Select the object to track (e.g., the ball) using OpenCV's selectROI function.
Tracker Setup: Initialize the tracker with the first frame and the selected bounding box.
Tracking and Visualization: Read frames from the video, update the tracker, draw the bounding box, and append the center coordinates to the trajectory list.
Display and Exit: Display the frames and exit on key press.
Key Assumptions:
The object's movement is smooth and continuous.
The object does not occlude or interact with other objects.
Implementation Note:
This code utilizes the CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking) algorithm, which is robust to changes in object size, orientation, and color.
Feel free to experiment with alternative tracking algorithms (e.g., KCF, MIL, TLD) for enhanced performance.
Submission Requirements:
Please attach a sample output video/image to the email, if applicable.
